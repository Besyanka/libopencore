Added transcluder_middleware module and a `libopencore#transcluder` entry point
for a paste.filter_factory.

If using transcluder middleware, Transcluder must be installed.

If using transcluder middleware, it should be the outermost wsgi filter
in your stack. This is because Transcluder sometimes makes internal WSGI
subrequests instead of HTTP calls, and calls its inner app.  So if you
have routing, security or anything else important outside Transcluder,
you may get strange results.

Added deliverance_middleware, wsgi, and http_proxy modules.

Added a sample paste.ini file showing how to combine these into a frontend app
that proxies to opencore, tasktracker and wordpress, and themes the responses
with deliverance when necessary.
